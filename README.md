# Homework4
App that allows for user input to locate a place and plot it in a map.
Starter files should be under AndroidStudioProjects/Erasable.


The name of our app is called Erasable, it will take you to an initial screen where the user can input a location into a text field and then pressed the “Send” button. After clicking the button, the app will take the user to a new screen where it will show the fragment of google maps with a marker in the location that the user inputted. 

The reason why we chose to do it this way was because when we had both the text field and the fragment map in the same screen it became hard to size both fields and they became dependent on the screen size of the emulator. 

Also, due to time constraints, we just focus on the base assignment because we didn’t have much time to work on the homework. We were planning to return nearby places around the inputted location if we would had more time to work on it.
